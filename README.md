# fst - Fuzzy Set Theory implementation in Haskell

## Description

If *X* is a collection of objects denoted generically by *x*, then a fuzzy set *F(A)* in *X* is a set of ordered pairs. Each of them consists of an element *x* and a membership function which maps *x* to the membership space *M*. The current implementation is inspired by the work of J.A. Goguen "L-fuzzy sets." [[1](#lfuzzysets)].
